List to Features to Add
-------------------------

// Might need to hold off on this feature as it may not allign with IOS design patterns.
// Usually a text field at the top of the window is only for a search field and not adding values
// to a list.
- Add task item text field in the same window as the list of task items
    - animation for this field should be similar to the search field in the Apple "Contacts" app
    - scrolling up and down should work like the search bar in Facebook

- Save the added values to the phone
    - eventually want the data saved on ICloud to be able to sync with multiple devices

- Be able to delete Task
    - maybe swipe delete or checkbox delete

- Task Due date
    - be able to set a due date
    - have different sections in the list of tasks separated by the due dates
    - show the items which are due today in a notification widget
